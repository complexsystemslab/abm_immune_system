CyCells is written in C++.  It has only been tested under linux.

User manual is in user.pdf.

Be aware that both the simulator and the documentation are works in
progress.  Development of the simulator is proceeding in parallel with 
development of models of specific biologic systems of interest to me, and
the functionality provided reflects capabilities that I have found useful.
My primary interest has been in making it easy (for me) to accomodate multiple
models with the same simulator, and to add code for new model components as 
necessary.  Ease of use by others and efficiency have not been top priorities 
so far; there is a great deal that could be done in these areas.  
In particular, there are a lot of ways in which the code will let you hang
yourself; it is up to you to make sure your time step size is appropriate,
that a calculated value is appropriate to use as a probability, etc.
However, I am willing to help resolve problems you encounter, and interested 
in suggestions you may have.
